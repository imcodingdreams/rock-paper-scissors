<!--PSEUDOCODE
User can select a rock, paper or scissors

When a user selects rock, paper or scissors the screen will display:
  -what the computer player has chosen
  -whether they have won or lost that game

The user can play as many times as they want

A score of total wins and losses will be displayed on the screen

LOGIC

User score starts in 0
Computer score starts in 0
Once the player choses, print "The user chose <choice>"
Then, the computer chose <the computer pick a random choice>
and print "The user chose <choice>"
Compare both choices
Print the result "The <player> won!"
Add user point.
If it's a tie computer will print ("It was a tie") and no points will be added to the score

Create an array with the options for choices
User vs Computer
rock + scissors = (rock wins) user wins
rock + paper = (paper wins) computer wins
rock + rock = (it's a tie!) no one wins
paper + scissors = (scissors win) computer wins
paper + paper = (it's a tie!) no one wins
paper + rock = (paper wins) user wins
scissors + scissors = (it's a tie!) no one wins
scissors + paper = (scissors win) user wins
scissors + rock = (rock wins) computer wins
