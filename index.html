<!--PSEUDOCODE
User can select a rock, paper or scissors

When a user selects rock, paper or scissors the screen will display:
  -what the computer player has chosen
  -whether they have won or lost that game

The user can play as many times as they want

A score of total wins and losses will be displayed on the screen

PSEUDOCODE

DECLARE a variable to hold the user's choice.
DECLARE a variable to hold the computer's choice.
DECLARE a variable to hold the user's score.
DECLARE a variable to hold the computer's score.
DECLARE a variable to hold who won.
COMPARE user's choice and computer's choice.
IF the choice is:
  User vs Computer
  rock + scissors = (rock wins) user wins
  rock + paper = (paper wins) computer wins
  rock + rock = (it's a tie!) no one wins
  paper + scissors = (scissors win) computer wins
  paper + paper = (it's a tie!) no one wins
  paper + rock = (paper wins) user wins
  scissors + scissors = (it's a tie!) no one wins
  scissors + paper = (scissors win) user wins
  scissors + rock = (rock wins) computer wins
IF the user won
  ADD a +1 point to the user's score
IF the computer won
  ADD a +1 point to the computer's score
IF it was a tie
  DON'T add any points to the players

LOGIC

User score starts in 0
Computer score starts in 0
Once the user choses, print ("The user chose <choice>)"
Then, the computer chose <the computer pick a random choice>
and print ("The user chose <choice>")
Compare both choices
Print the result ("The <player> won!")
Add user or computer a point.
If it's a tie computer will print ("It was a tie") and no points will be added to the score
